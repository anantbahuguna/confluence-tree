# CONFLUENCE TREE

## Learnings -

- Build some basic layout components -> then add functionaliy -> then styling -> animations etc. Iteratively enhance the solution so that we have something to show for at every milestone.
- `Boolean()` works the same as `!!` for converting non-boolean to boolean

# Additional requirements -

- Connect links with react-router to render pages
- What if server only sends use data upto 1 depth with a flag like hasChildren. So now, we'll send the server the node's id to fetch it's children.
